Free web browser poker game you can play

You are given money to play with and you may bet any amount (even more than you have at the moment)

If you are unfamiliar with the rules, you can see them on this site: https://www.pokernews.com/poker-rules/texas-holdem.htm

The game follows them (mostly) I plan on adding future updates to fix bugs and add new features.

Shout out to https://deckofcardsapi.com for the great free deck api I used for the decks!
